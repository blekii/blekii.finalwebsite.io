notes: 
- explore page only shows stats for 2023 season (free version of the API key lol)
- also only for top 5 leagues listed
- comparison couldn't account for goalkeeper stats from eafc since they have separate categories (i only realized towards the end and didn't have time to adjust)
- i just checked the rubric and saw that we were supposed to commit a lot, i saved it mostly locally, can show history if needed
